Good evening, everyone. I am Lambert.Wang. I’m a common user of AirbNb. Today I’m gonna introduce the famous house sharing website to you. I’ve divided my talk into 4 parts. First, I will give you some basic information about the company. Then I will talk about their vision, goals and strategic partnerships. Next, I will tell you about the customer base and financial highlights. Finally, I will present other information. My presentation will last 4 minutes. I’m happy to field questions at the end of the presentation. Let’s start with company history. AirbNb is founded by Brian Chesky and Joe Gebbia in San Francisco in 2007. Now it has over 3,000,000 lodging listings in 65,000 cities and 191 countries. Right, so the company mission is to help creating a world where you can belong anywhere and where people can live a place, instead of just traveling to it. AirbNb doesn’t provide houses itself. Instead, registered house owners from all over the world are the main partners and AirbNb charges 3%-5% host service fee from them. Now let’s move on to customer base. Well, AirbNb welcomes people from all over the world at any age to use the website for finding their suitable place to live. At most time, customers are at their 20's to 60's. Unfortunately, since AirbNb hasn't started its IPO, the avenue hasn't been exposed. But considering it fast growth, the profit YoY should be considerable. Finally, the official website of AirbNb is www.airbnb.com, once you sign up, you will get  a coupon that values 200 RMB. If you use my user-code to register, both you and me will get the coupon. The coupon could be used when you reservation fee is higher than 1000 OK. So this is my presentation and thank you for listening. Any question is welcomed.
